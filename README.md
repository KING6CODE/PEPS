# PEPS - Next.js + Tailwind (Vercel-ready)


This repository is a professional, responsive Next.js project styled with Tailwind CSS. It's prefilled with the content from the old PEPS site and a modern layout based on the new mockup provided.


## Setup


1. Install dependencies: `npm install`
2. Run development server: `npm run dev`
3. Build: `npm run build`
4. Deploy: Connect the repo to Vercel and deploy. Vercel will use the `build` script.


## Notes
- Replace images in `/public/images` with the client's images.
- Update contact details if needed.
- If you want forms to send real emails, connect an email provider or API (Formspree, Netlify Forms, or a small serverless endpoint).
